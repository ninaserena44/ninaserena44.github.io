        <p class="top-paragraph">Hello! I'm Serena Nina, a passionate and creative individual who loves exploring the world of technology and design. I'm from Kenya, a beautiful country with rich culture and vibrant communities. I love coding and I'm eager to learn more about it every day. When I'm not coding, you'll often find me enjoying simple pleasures like eating chocolate and ice cream, watching my favorite movies, or going out for a swim. I also enjoy cooking delicious homemade meals, especially when i get to try out new recipes and share them with family and friends.</p>
        <p class="bottom-paragraph">My passion for Computer Programming goes beyond just writing code. I want to use it to venture in the exciting field of forensics. I find joy in solving problems and creating things that are both functional and beautiful. I believe that by combining technology and investigative skills, I can contribute to solving real-world problems. I'm committed to growing my skills and exploring how programming can open new doors in the forensic field and beyond for me.</p>
